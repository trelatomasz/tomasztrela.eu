# Building a Modern Website with Cursor AI

I started by asking Cursor AI for recommendations on modern web technologies. Having used Jekyll previously, I wanted something similar - easy to edit, no CMS, and lightweight. The proposed solution was:

- **Astro framework** - Modern static site generator
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Markdown templates** - Simple content management

---

## The Initial Challenge

The first version generated by Cursor was a messy blog structure with all content hardcoded in a single file. I refined my requirements to Cursor:

- Individual blog posts in separate files
- Clean component architecture  
- Separation of content from styles
- Type-safe content management

Much better!

### Add support for Markdwon templates.

Moved from a single messy markdown file to a clean content structure:
Implemented Astro's content collections for robust content handling:
- Individual post pages at `/blog/[slug]`
- Automatic generation from markdown files
- Clean URLs and SEO-friendly structure
- Category filtering and tag management

```
src/content/blog/
├── building-a-website-using-cursor-ai.md
└── [future posts...]
```

Each post includes proper frontmatter:

```markdown

title: "Post Title"
excerpt: "Brief description"
date: "2025-01-15"
readTime: "5 min read"
tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2"]
featured: false
---
```

### Styles

The Markdown post styling was ugly :/ Need to fix that.

TODO: fix the styles!

## Add a diagram
Finally I want my blog to contain nice diagrams. A content with diagram is so muuch more professional!
Let's add a diagram how this page is constructed.

TODO: add diagram!

## Lessons Learned

1. **AI Assistance**: Cursor AI excels at generating boilerplate and structure
1. **Iterative Development**: Build incrementally and refine continuously

## Conclusion

Building this website with Cursor AI and Astro demonstrated the power of modern development tools. The combination of AI assistance, static site generation, and component-based architecture resulted in a clean, maintainable, and performant website.
