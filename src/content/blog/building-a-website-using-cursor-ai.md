# Building a Modern Website with Cursor AI

I started by asking Cursor AI for recommendations on modern web technologies. Having used Jekyll previously, I wanted something similar - easy to edit, no CMS, and lightweight. The proposed solution was:

- **Astro framework** - Modern static site generator
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first styling
- **Markdown templates** - Simple content management

---

## The Initial Challenge

The first version generated by Cursor was a messy blog structure with all content hardcoded in a single file. I refined my requirements to Cursor:

- Individual blog posts in separate files
- Clean component architecture  
- Separation of content from styles
- Type-safe content management

Much better!

### Add support for Markdown templates.

Moved from a single messy markdown file to a clean content structure.
Implemented Astro's content collections for robust content handling:
- Individual post pages at `/blog/[slug]`
- Automatic generation from markdown files
- Clean URLs and SEO-friendly structure
- Category filtering and tag management

```

â””â”€â”€ [future posts...]
```

Each post includes proper frontmatter:

```markdown

title: "Post Title"
excerpt: "Brief description"
date: "2025-01-15"
readTime: "5 min read"
tags: ["Tag1", "Tag2"]
featured: false
---
```

### Styles

The Markdown post styling was ugly :/ Need to fix that.

First, I asked Cursor to explain the styles used in Markdown. I wanted to understand how styles are organized.

âœ… Styles fixed with just a 1 prompt! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

## Add some ~~diagrams~~

Finally, I want my blog to contain nice diagrams. Content with diagrams is so much more professional!
Let's add a diagram showing how this page is constructed.

In general. It's an Astro framework page, which uses Markdown templates. I want to add support for Mermaid diagrams.

Oh shoot! Not so easy. The idea to embed Mermaid inside a Markdown inside Astro template is nice! And Cursor happily creates solution, only it's not working. Vibe coding begins! Going back and forth with Cursor. It claims it knows solution, but apparently it does not work. And when I think on the proposed solution, they just should not work. After spending 1.5h I decide to change strategy. Mermaid templates in browser is nice, but let's simplify it a bit. Let's generate diagrams images and refer to them in Markdown. This should be easier.

### Website Architecture & Deployment Flow

Here's a comprehensive diagram showing how this Astro website works, from development to deployment:

Success! 


## Lessons Learned

1. **AI Assistance**: Cursor AI excels at generating boilerplate and structure
2. **Iterative Development**: Build incrementally and refine continuously

## Conclusion

Building this website with Cursor AI and Astro demonstrated the power of modern development tools. The combination of AI assistance, static site generation, and component-based architecture resulted in a clean, maintainable, and performant website.
